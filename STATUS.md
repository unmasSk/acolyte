## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Backend Service**: Currently commented out in `docker-compose.yml`
2. **Never Tested**: The entire system has never been run end-to-end
3. **Installation Unknown**: Scripts exist but have never been executed
4. **Port System**: Auto-assignment logic is theoretical
5. **Dream System**: Complex logic that's never been triggered

## 📈 Quality Metrics

## 🎯 Milestones to Alpha

### v0.0.1-pre-alpha (Current)
- [x] Complete source code
- [x] Unit tests >90% coverage
- [x] Basic documentation structure

### v0.1.0-alpha (Next)
- [ ] First successful installation
- [ ] Backend running and responding
- [ ] Basic chat functionality working
- [ ] Project indexing validated
- [ ] Fix critical bugs found

### v0.2.0-alpha
- [ ] Multi-project support tested
- [ ] Dream system activated successfully
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<5s responses)
- [ ] Basic user documentation

### v0.3.0-beta
- [ ] 10+ successful installations
- [ ] All features working reliably
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] No critical bugs

## 🚨 Critical Path

Before ANY real use, these MUST be completed:

1. **Validate Installation**: Someone needs to run `install.bat/sh` successfully
2. **Start Services**: Get Docker containers running
3. **Test API**: Confirm backend responds to health check
4. **Index Project**: Verify code indexing works
5. **Chat Test**: Send a message and get a response

## 📝 Notes

- This project was developed entirely through AI collaboration
- All code was written to pass tests, but real-world behavior is unknown
- The architecture is sound in theory but unproven in practice
- Expect significant issues during first deployment attempts

## 🤝 How to Help

1. **Be the first tester**: Try to install and report what happens
2. **Document issues**: Every error message helps
3. **Fix problems**: PRs welcome for any issues found
4. **Improve docs**: Help explain what actually works

---

**Bottom Line**: ACOLYTE is a complete codebase that has never been run. It's like a rocket on the launch pad that's never been ignited. Proceed with extreme caution and low expectations.
